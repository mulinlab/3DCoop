To save space, only little files used for reference were uploaded into certain folders, including:

* `inputs/peaks/HMEC`
* `outputs/01_intersection_bed/HMEC`
* `outputs/02_intersection_bedpe/HMEC`



Some big results were not uploaded, including:
* `outputs/03_jaccard`
* `outputs/05_clusterone/04_cliques`
